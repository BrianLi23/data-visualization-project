# ICS4U CPT - Data Visualization - Brian Li

As our current world has seen continuous rapid growth in AI Technologies, I wanted to explore this area of study in hopes of educating myself more in regards to the correlation and difference of old and newly developed Artificial Intelligence systems. The data set shown in this CPT displays the number of test parameters used in notable artificial intelligence systems as well as its domain type and entity. The data ranges from the 1900s to the current year.

For my CPT, I displayed data on a dynamic bar graph where users can search and add whichever artificial system they want as well as in a scatterplot. There is also a data table containing all the data points.
